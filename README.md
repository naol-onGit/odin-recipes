# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes is a beginner-friendly HTML project where I built a small website to showcase multiple recipes. The project involves creating a home page with links to individual recipe pages, and each recipe page contains a heading, image, description, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions.

    - By completing this project, I have demonstrated the following skills:

    - Creating and structuring HTML files with proper boilerplate

    - Organizing multiple pages within directories and linking between them

    - Using headings, images, paragraphs, and lists to display content

    - Building basic navigation within a website

This project helped me practice fundamental web development concepts, especially structuring content and connecting pages for a seamless user experience.
