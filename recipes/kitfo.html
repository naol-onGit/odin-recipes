    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Kitfo</strong> is a traditional Ethiopian dish made from finely minced raw beef, seasoned with a special
        blend of spices called <em>mitmita</em> and clarified butter (<em>niter kibbeh</em>). The meat is typically
        served lightly warmed, though it can also be fully cooked according to personal preference.
        <strong>Kitfo</strong> is known for its rich, buttery flavor and delicate texture, making it one of the most
        celebrated dishes in Ethiopian cuisine. It is often enjoyed on special occasions and is a staple in many
        Ethiopian households.

    <p>
        This dish is traditionally served with <strong>gomen</strong> (spiced collard greens) and <strong>ayib</strong>
        (a mild Ethiopian cheese) on the side, along with <strong>injera</strong>, a soft, sourdough flatbread that acts
        as both a plate and utensil. Some variations may also include <em>kochko</em> (spiced clarified butter) or a
        fresh salad to complement the rich flavors of the <strong>kitfo</strong>. Together, these sides balance the
        spiciness and richness of the dish, creating a harmonious and authentic Ethiopian dining experience.
